# Writing Style Analysis

You will be analyzing the writing style of a text sample and creating a comprehensive guide for reproducing that style. Here is the writing sample to analyze:

<writing_sample>
{{WRITING_SAMPLE}}
</writing_sample>

Your task is to analyze the writing style of this sample and create a detailed guide in Markdown format that would allow someone to reproduce this style in their own writing.

Writing style encompasses many elements, including but not limited to:
- Diction (word choice, vocabulary level, formality)
- Sentence structure (length, complexity, variety)
- Syntax (grammatical arrangements, patterns)
- Figurative language (metaphors, similes, imagery)
- Rhythm and pacing
- Sound patterns (alliteration, assonance, consonance)
- Narration style (first/third person, perspective)
- Description techniques (concrete vs. abstract, sensory details)
- Rhetorical patterns (repetition, parallelism, questions)
- Voice and tone (formal/informal, serious/playful, objective/subjective)
- Brevity vs. elaboration
- Coherence and flow
- Unity and focus

Before beginning your analysis, create a pre-analysis checklist inside <pre_analysis_checklist> tags. This checklist should include items to verify you understand the task and are prepared to analyze all relevant style elements.

Then, conduct your detailed analysis inside <analysis_scratchpad> tags. In this scratchpad:
1. Read through the writing sample carefully, multiple times if needed
2. Identify and note specific examples of each style element present
3. Look for patterns and recurring features
4. Note what makes this style distinctive or unique
5. Consider how these elements work together to create the overall effect
6. Think about what concrete, actionable guidance would help someone reproduce this style

After completing your analysis, create a post-analysis checklist inside <post_analysis_checklist> tags to verify:
- You've covered all major style elements present in the sample
- You've provided specific, actionable guidance
- You've included concrete examples from the text
- Your guide is well-organized and easy to follow
- The Markdown formatting is correct

Finally, write your style guide inside <style_guide> tags. The guide should be formatted in Markdown and structured as follows:

# Writing Style Guide

## Overview
[Brief summary of the overall style]

## Key Style Elements

### Diction
[Analysis and guidance with examples]

### Sentence Structure
[Analysis and guidance with examples]

### [Other relevant style elements]
[Continue for each significant element identified]

## Reproduction Checklist
[A practical checklist writers can use to ensure they're matching the style]

## Examples and Non-Examples
[If helpful, show what does and doesn't match the style]

Make sure your style guide is:
- Specific and actionable (not vague observations)
- Supported by concrete examples from the text
- Organized logically
- Written in clear, accessible language
- Formatted properly in Markdown

Your final output should contain only the pre-analysis checklist, post-analysis checklist, and the complete style guide in Markdown format inside the appropriate tags. The analysis scratchpad is for your internal work and will help you create a thorough guide, but the style guide itself should be polished and ready to use.
